There was once a hare[n] who was friends with a tortoise[n]. 
One day, he challenged[v] the tortoise to a race[v]. 
Seeing how slow[a] the tortoise was going, 
the hare thought heâ€™ll win[v] this easily. 
So he[n] took a nap while the tortoise kept on going. 
When the hare[n] woke up, he saw that the tortoise was already at the finish line. Much to his chagrin, 
the tortoise won the race[n] while he was busy sleeping[v].
